Logger TXT - Quick command line logging
=======================================

Logger TXT is meant as a small tool to log activities throughout the day to a simple, portable text file, along with the date/time. Options are available to log a specific entry under a type and project. All entries are stored in log.txt which is automatically created in the folder where logger.sh resides.

Example output in log.txt
-------------------------

31/01/11 13:30 - PERSONAL (PROJECT) - This is a log note with a type and project

31/01/11 13:35 - PERSONAL - This is a log not with just a type

31/01/11 13:40 - (PROJECT) - This is a log not with just a project


Main Goals
==========

The main goal of this project was to create a simple logging tool which could be accessed quickly from within the command line environment. By storing all data in a TXT file, you're not locked into always using this or limited to only viewing log events with this script. The data portability that a TXT file offeres between tools, operating systems and environments is crutial to having a smooth workflow that is extremly dependable.

What do you use it for anyways?!?
=================================

Over time the act of logging will be come habitual. Over the course of a day you may log any of the following and anything else you deem important.

- Progress of tasks related to work and/or specific projects
  - Extremely handy when it comes to filling in hours with an employer as you can easily look up what projects were worked on, on that tuesday two weeks ago.
- Progress of personal tasks or projects
  - Progress logging is the main use of this tool
- Purchases made
  - Extremely useful when the credit card bill comes with cryptic names of companies.
- Log important events or anything where the time that it happened is important.
