Searching
---------
- Add case sensitive search as -S option
  - Update help text for case sensitive/insensitive searching
- Add ability to search specifically by type and/or project 
  - examples
    - Just show all "WORK" related entries
    - Just show all "(PROJECT)" related entries
    - Show all work items from a specific project

Improvements
------------
- Ability to create a status report
  - Still formulating how this will work and what the result will be
- Web App instead of native mobile app
  - Ties into dropbox
  - Do everything that I'd want to do with a native app, but on the web
  - Write in zend?
- Add time limit for deleting the last line from the file
  - Make is so that this must be triggered within a time limit from the time the last line was entered. This will help prevent accidental deletions later in time
- Ability to list items between certain dates or within the previous X days etc

Bugs
----
- $'s are not properly escaped
- !'s are not properly escaped
